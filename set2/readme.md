TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
#return variable.upper()—>make variable upper case
#return variable.lower()—>make variable lower case
#remember to define function and the answer.. () after the .upper/.lower function is to call the function

#dictionaries have key: value pairs
#I.e: {“name”:”Cake”}

#if variable1 > variable 2 :
#if variable 1 and variable 2 is true
#print(“string”)
#elif variable1 == variable 2:
#or else if variable 1 and 2 is equal
#print (“string”)
#else:
#or else (if false) print
#print(“string”)

#calling: call to a function
#f-string:
name = "Dave"
age = 40
formatted_string = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
print(formatted_string)
#you can include functions in f-strings

#uname: a function to show system info
#string: string module which is a part of the Python Standard Library
#string.ascii*lowercase is a static constant that gives you a string of all lowercase letters, while str.lower() is a method that you call on a string object to convert it to lowercase.
#getLetter(index): retrieves a letter from the alphabet based on a given index.
#.join(list): a string method that takes all items in a list and concatenates them into one single string
#in "".join(wordArray): "" should be the separator (thing between joined elements), here it means that nothing will be between the joined elements
#modulo division: A%B=C where A is divided by B and C is the remainder of the division
#star_list = [] creates a new empty list called star_list
#for loop: for i in range (x): iterate smtg x times, The loop will execute the indented block of code for each value of x. (rmb 0 indexing, so i will be 9 if your range is 10)
#indented list.append("*"): Inside the loop, a single star ('\_') is added to the star_list on each iteration.

#exercise2 prints MC Hammer twice
