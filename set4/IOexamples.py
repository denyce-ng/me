"""IO examples.

Using file IO, from the docs:
    "The first argument is a string containing the filename. The second
    argument is another string containing a few characters describing the
    way in which the file will be used. 
    mode can be
    'r' when the file will only be read,
    'w' for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased),
    and 'a' opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end.
    'r+' opens the file for both reading and writing. The mode argument is optional; 'r' will be
    assumed if it's omitted."
