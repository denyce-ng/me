TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

I started the lecture off by being extra sleepy but everything got better once we got to the lab session where we really got to do some work with coding.

I found coding kinda cool? and interesting I guess but there is definitely much more I need to learn. I am a bit unclear about what some commands/functions work though, so I could maybe ask ChatGPT about how certain stuff work. I am also unclear about the VS Code interface so watching youtube explanations could help.

I find it super cool that an application I code locally with could upload things to github which is an online platform.

ayyyyy
